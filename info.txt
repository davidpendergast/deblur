This is an experimental tool that blurs and deblurs images.

User Guide
----------

1. Top Bar
  Contains the overall mode selector and options for importing/exporting images.
  a. Mode selector. Select between different viewing modes.
  b. Original image selector. Choose a preloaded image or import your own to blur.
  c. Blurred image selector. Choose a preloaded image or select your own to deblur. 
     Choose "(Apply Blur)" to deblur the current original image.
  d. Export image selector. Save generated images to disk.

2. Blur Settings
  Only available in Blur & Deblur Mode. Controls for blurring the original image.
  a. Blur type selector. Determines the type of blur that's applied.
  b. Radius slider. Determines the blurring radius. Higher radius = more blurry.

3. Simulation Settings
  Playback controls for the deblurring algorithm.
  a. Stop, Restart, Play/Pause, Reset, and Step buttons.
     These control the iterative deblurring procedure.
  b. Iteration limit slider. How many iterations it should do before stopping.

4. Deblur Settings
  Controls for deblurring.
  a. Blur type selector. What kind of blur to reverse.
  b. Radius slider. What radius of blur to reverse.
  c. Advanced options. Honestly, these don't seem to be that useful.
     They control some of the inner workings of the deblurring algorithm
     but the default values are pretty much always fine. 

     The power settings control how much "randomness" should be added to guesses 
     at the first and last iteration, respectively. (Iterations in between use a 
     linearlly interpolated value). 

     The anti-blur setting affects how the error is calculated. I think there's
     never a reason to change it off 100% unless you want a glitchy result.
